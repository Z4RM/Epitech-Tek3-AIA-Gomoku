### Configuration

The configuration file must be named `config.ini` and is located in the root directory of the project.

First of all, copy the `config.ini.example` file and rename it to `config.ini`.

For the bot, the only used fields are the ` bot` section and `level` in the `log` section. The other fields are for the server (Liskvork).
